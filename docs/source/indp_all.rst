INDP
=======================================================
These modules and classes solve one optimization problem for the whole interdependent network, which leads to optimal restoration plans. The implication of such models is that the decision-maker is one entity who has the complete information and authority to restore all layers of the interdependent network. This kind of methods includes Interdependent Network Design Problem (INDP) :cite:`Gonzalez2016` and time-dependent INDP (td-INDP) :cite:`Gonzalez2016c`.
