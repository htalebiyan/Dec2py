N-INRG and B-INRG 
=======================================================
These modules and classes model a multi-agent decision-making environment where each agent has the authority to restore a single layer, has complete information about her respective layer, and minimal or no information about other layers. It is assumed that agents communicate poorly and not on time. The strategic decision-making is such a setting is modeled using Normal-form Interdependent Network Restoration Games (N-INRG) and Bayesian Games (B-INRG) :cite:`Talebiyan2021c`.
